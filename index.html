                <figcaption> 
                <p>A team culture without empathy is like trying to cook a cake without putting it in the oven. You may have all the other ingredients mixed together but the magic doesn’t happen until you apply the warmth (Empathy).</p>

                <p>When trying to get your team from Point A to Point B with empathy consider using this imagery.</p>
                    
                <p> Think of the individual's feelings like the contents of the mugs when carrying a full tray of hot drinks. Too fast you risk spilling what's important to them, too slow and the drinks will be cold and if you don't look ahead you may trip up on obstacles and spill it all.</p>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/2.png" alt="communication Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"> <figcaption> <p>Communication is such an integral part of leading. Think of communication like a see-saw. The person talking remains closer to the ground and the person listening is up in the air. A way to bring balance and engagement in communication is to create a safe space to hear the other person too.</p>
            <p>Try an open ended question about the ‘feeling’ of what is being discussed. Be comfortable with the time and silence it takes for a thoughtful response.</p>
            <p>If you notice you talk more in the next interaction you have, consider using the see-saw imagery and see if it helps.</p>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/5.png" alt="fun Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Penguin Posts - Google Docs</p><p>Creating a culture where adding “fun at work” to be part of the formal framework can help alleviate stress, strengthen team bonds, increase engagement, and build fond memories.
            </p><p>The skill of being able to find ‘fun’ for everyone in the team also requires conversation, collaboration, getting to know each other better, sharing, learning and compromise. All fantastic team building behaviours.</p>
        </figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/6.png" alt="flowers or butterflies Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Flowers or Butterflies?
            </p><p>Leadership comes with the privilege of helping a team and individuals with their growth. If done well this development has two focus points, their current role and their future role.
            </p><p>With the flowers metaphor, you can plant the seed, provide them with all they need to grow in that environment. They can blossom into something beautiful but they will always remain where their roots are.
            </p><p>The butterflies metaphor is very similar BUT includes taking the time to understand where they see themselves in their future.
            </p><p>With that knowledge you can work together to develop an engaging coaching/skill development program for their now and for their future.
            </p><p>The outcomes include increased trust, more engagement and higher job satisfaction.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/7.png" alt="coaching or catching Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Are you coaching or catching-out?
            </p><p>One of the most difficult skills to learn as a coaching leader is making the effort and investing the time to find the person being coached doing it the right way and using that as three quarters of their coaching.</p><p>Catching-out, is the natural and understandable default setting in coaching where the focus is solely on what went wrong, or could have been done better.
            </p><p>With the catching-out method, overtime people will associate coaching sessions with negativity and a non-valuable use of their time to be avoided.
            </p><p>Catching your people doing it right however and using it in coaching to celebrate the successes delivers a more positive coaching experience, positive reinforcement and is just as likely (if not more) to lead to earlier adoption of the required skill.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/8.png" alt="time management Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Feel like you’re running out of time?
            </p><p>One of the BEST coaching tips I ever received was about the power of the calendar.</p></figcaption><p>I was new in a more senior role, with new responsibilities, projects and leading a team of leaders. I felt like my time and attention was being pulled in many directions and I was genuinely panicking about meeting deadlines.
            </p><p>I sat down with my manager who asked to see my calendar. Apart from various meetings and coaching's scheduled there were gaps in my day. We sat down and started to look at how I could be more proactive about blocking out time in my calendar for specific items and ALSO SCHEDULING TIME ON A FRIDAY to prepare the following weeks' calendar.
            </p><p>It sounds so simple but that one strategy gave me back time, increased my productivity, my availability to the team and eliminated the feelings of juggling too many priorities.
            </p><p>Try blocking out the most important items first ('one on one' time with individuals in the team should make that list). Then back fill with the other priorities including breaks for you. I personally like to share my calendar with the team so they know where I am and why.
            </p><p>Have you got time to try this for next week?
            </p></figure>

           <figure> <img src="images/Penguins/9.png" alt="fall over Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>It’s not the falling over that counts. It is being able to ask for help that matters.</p><p>Leadership is a difficult role as every person in a team is unique, bringing unique perspective, behaviours and expectations. This creates a multitude of variables in an environment where the win is a team enjoying working and succeeding as one.</p><p>Identifying another leader who you can share your challenges with and learn from isn’t about helping you solve your problems. It’s about identifying leadership themes and helping grow your experience in embracing them.
</p><p>Finding someone to help guide you through a challenging experience and be better off because of it makes it more likely you will do the same for the individuals you lead, making you the ideal leader.
</p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/10.png" alt="meetings or borings Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Team Meetings or ‘ Team Borings’?
            </p><p>Ideally you want people leaving your meetings feeling informed, clear on purpose (actions), heard, onboard, motivated and awake.
            </p><p>Here are some tips that took my meetings from rambling shambles to a highlight of my week.
            </p><p><ol><li>Send out invites with an agenda that includes: time, room, a time allocation of items being discussed and any pre-reading you can reasonably expect done prior.
            </li><li>Start on time and aim to finish early.
            </li><li>A meeting with a snack of some kind is generally well received.
            </li><li>f you have the time at the beginning and it’s appropriate some form of fun activity</li><li>Celebrate any team successes while everyone is together.
            </li><li>Start with important items first and anticipate allocating time for questions and clarifications
            </li><li>A clear goal, timeframes, roles and responsibilities
            </li><li>A Note taker who can share the minutes and goals afterwards
            </li></ol></p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/11.png" alt="positive feedback Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>As a leader, what is your ratio of giving constructive feedback to positive feedback?</p><p>The power of authentic, positive feedback from a manager on a job well done has flow on benefits to the individual, their growth and team culture.
            </p><p>Consider keeping a simple tally of interactions. Mark one column for positive feedback on a job well done and another for constructive coaching. The ideal is around four pieces of positive feedback to every constructive feedback.
            </p><p>Why?</p><p>Try thinking of it like this:
            </p><p>Compliments and positive feedback on work well done are like helium balloons, uplifting and fun.
            </p><p>Constructive feedback is more like a rock, feels a bit heavier and grounds you to your current place in your development.
            </p><p>If your goal is always to keep your people progressing up, then you would need more helium balloons than rocks.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/12.png" alt="river of change Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Does everyone in the team you work with deal with Change (challenges) the same way?

            </p><p>People’s reactions to change are as diverse as people themselves, including you. The cautionary tale to avoid is applying what works for you as a universal fit for everyone.
            </p><p>A big part of leading teams through change is being able to ‘be there’ for them when they experience the very natural feelings associated with change. Helping guide them through the transitionary period and equipping them with the right tools until the confidence from experience kicks in.

             <figure><img src="images/Penguins/13.png" alt="take time to smell the coffee Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption><p>Take time to smell the coffee!
            </p><p>Leadership is a rewarding and equally challenging position.
            </p><p>I’ve been in leadership roles for the past twenty years and I know first hand how hard it can feel sometimes.
            </p><p>You get asked the hard questions that couldn’t be answered. You have to make the difficult decisions and have the difficult conversations that no-one really wants to have and you’re making decisions that impact the lives of customers and the people you lead. It adds up.
            </p><p>It’s important that you are aware you need to take the time to recharge throughout a day.
            </p><p>Think of the well worn analogy of ‘putting out fires’. Fire-breaks in the bush are a solution born out of a necessity to prevent fires from getting out of control and to make it easier to manage.
            </p><p>A 10 minute mindfulness break, such as a quiet coffee out of the office, meditation or a walk are all forms of ‘Fire-Breaks’ to help ensure you are fully charged to deal with what comes your way.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/14.png" alt="caring Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>The most important facet of leadership, in my experience, is the ability to connect.
            </p><p>If you can lead from the front by connecting with people, taking the time to “care” about what is important to them and sharing what's important to you, the dynamic of a team culture changes.
            </p><p>Consider this, there are 168 hours in a 7 day week. If the people you work with do a 40 hour work week, that means roughly 75% of their time is spent elsewhere.
            </p><p>That makes up a majority percentage of who they are and what they care about and that has a big influence on who/how they are at work.
            </p><p>Being genuine about taking the time to care about that 75% of them is the key to connection.
            </p><p>Connections are bonds. Strong bonds bring teams closer together. Being closer together makes it easier to communicate, making it easier to all head in the same direction, at the same time, and for the right reasons.</p></figcaption>

           <figure> <img src="images/Penguins/15.png" alt="collaborative manager Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> 
            <p>Why does Leader C’s style gain success first?
            </p><p>Consider Leader-A the “micro-manager”. Carrying the team is slow and heavy work and the team can only move at the managers bogged-down pace. It is over-reliant on the manager.
            </p><p>Consider Leader-B the “command and control manager”. A clear goal, a structure and drive to get there fast but the communication is all one way. In this case the team carries the manager and the structure is over-reliant on those doing most the work.
            </p><p>Consider Leader-C the “collaborative manager”. Everyone is on the same level, communicating and sharing information, sharing the work and supporting each other. In this case the reliance is shared equally ("many feet make light work").
            </p></figcaption></figure>

           <figure> <img src="images/Penguins/16.png" alt="the right tools Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Are you equipping people with the best tools for the job?
        </p>><p>Whether it is a “physical” or ” soft-skill”, the right tool for the job (and environment) always makes the task more efficient.</p><p>We have full control over equipping people with soft-skills, which include:
        </p><p>Safe space: Teach me the influence engagement and empathy has on the environment.
        </p><p>Coaching: Teach me the best-practice techniques to give and receive feedback.
        </p><p>A Goal: Teach me the benefits effective goal setting plays in being successful.
        </p><p>Training: Teach me the positive outcomes that continual improvement has on job satisfaction. problem solving and personal development.
        </p><p>Team: Teach me the importance collaboration has in achieving success.
        </p><p>Recognition: Teach me the relevance of celebration and recognition in growth.

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/17.png" alt="Talking loudly Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Talking loudly or over the top of people doesn’t make you more right. In fact, it’s more likely that your message will be lost and only your behaviour remembered (how you made them feel).
            </p><p>How do you remind yourself to “listen to learn” instead of “listening to retort”?
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/18.png" alt="don't panic Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>How much of what you say is aligned with your actions?
            </p><p>It’s widely accepted non-verbal communication, like body language and actions account for the vast majority of how a message is received.
            </p><p>Why is this important to remember?
            </p><p>People are more likely to follow your actions than your words. If you’re not being mindful of your actions, you might be inadvertently undermining what you are setting out to achieve.
            </p><p>And just importantly, this doesn’t mean you should be fake.
            </p><p>It means that if you are having concerns and doubts, it is likely others are too. Therefore, it is much more leader-like and productive to sit down and proactively discuss those concerns in the right environment and move forward as a team.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/19.png" alt="mirror mirror Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>The most important person to get to know in the team is yourself.
            </p><p>Taking the time to get to understand what makes you tick as a person and as a leader is crucial to your success in the role.
            </p><p>Understanding that we all come with default settings, habits, outlooks and values not only gives you an opportunity to grow and develop but just as importantly, it also helps you better appreciate and respect the same is true of others.
            </p><p>There are a range of free resources or surveys on the internet starting from Myers Briggs through to Leadership Style surveys and articles.
            </p><p>These will help you get a better picture of who you are, how you react, how others might perceive you and also gives you insight into how others see the world and the most beneficial ways to interact with them.

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/20.png" alt="how do you hear it? Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Making space for everyone in a team to be heard is a recipe for team success.
            </p><p>There are many reasons why a person may find it difficult to be able to share their ideas in group environments. It would be an oversight to assume it’s because their ideas aren’t relevant or valuable.
            </p><p>Think of gold as an example. People will go to great depths to mine what can’t be seen because of its value. The insights from the person who appears withdrawn and reserved can be just as rich.
            </p><p>Taking the time to get to know and understand everyone’s communication style and then providing them the right environment to be able to offer their input will add real value to the team.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/21.png" alt="leadership shadow Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>The 'Leadership Shadow You Cast' is a concept that your actions have a far wider impact than just on yourself.
            </p><p>We ALL have bad days but people will take guidance from what they see you do, hear you say and how you act as being appropriate for the workplace.
            </p><p>By focusing on becoming a role model for the behaviours that are conducive to a positive work environment you can flip that concept into a more positive practice.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/22.png" alt="growing people or clones Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Developing individuals potential isn’t the same as teaching them to be like you.
            </p><p>What worked well for you is a recipe for your success. Insisting others mimic you to be successful is to the detriment of the team’s diversity, new thinking, creativity and the individual's potential.
            </p><p>Provide them the tools, teach the skills and then let them be free to create and evolve.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/23.png" alt="Pareto Principal Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Be mindful of not inverting the Pareto Principle of 80/20 when Leading a Team.
            </p><p>It’s all too easy to hold up an entire team while spending 80% of your time on the 20% that really are struggling with the current task.
            </p><p>This leaves you with only 20% of your time left for the other 80% of the team.
            </p><p>This leads to a bottle-neck of progress which impacts everyone (and in reality can load even more stress and pressure on the 20% that are struggling).
            </p><p>Does this mean you ignore the 20% struggling? NO! That goes against everything that leadership is about.
            </p><p>What it does highlight is that a Leader’s time is a precious commodity for everyone in a team and it needs to be shared equally.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/24.png" alt="trust Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Building and maintaining trust as a leader is vital for a team if you want respect and a good working relationship to part of the culture.
            </p><p>In my experience this can be as easy as:
            </p><p>Following through on the commitments you make to the team and to individuals ( e.g. approving leave and overtime, showing up for coaching).
            </p><p>Always being honest and authentic (e.g. if you don’t know the answer it’s better to go with that, than a bluff).
            </p><p>Remembering what is important to individuals (e.g. caring enough to learn about children or family members names or important events).
            </p><p>Acting with integrity ( e.g. practicing what you preach and treating others how you would like to be treated).
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/25.png" alt="clear instructions Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>The importance of giving clear steps and direction to those carrying out the work is vital if you want the outcome to be aligned with what you envisioned.
            </p><p>Take asking someone to put the dishes in the dishwasher for example. We all know someone who technically does what they are asked. However, if the intent was to have the dirty dishes stacked evenly, facing the correct position enabling them to be properly cleaned then that ‘how’ and ‘why’ needs to be included in the steps.</p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/26.png" alt="coaching tools Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Being able to provide tailored tools for coaching development is key to how quickly performance improves.
            </p><p>People learn differently and the best way to find the right tool for coaching is to get to know the person's preference by asking the right questions.
            </p><p>How do they ‘feel’ about what is being taught?. Understanding the emotion attached to what is being taught gives insight into any additional hurdles.
            </p><p>How do they learn best? Do they prefer theory? Practice? Best practice examples? Auditory or Visual Learners?
            </p><p>How do they prefer to get positive and constructive feedback? In private? Written down and a chance to digest it?
            </p><p>Once you have this information you can tailor the coaching style from there on in, reducing time, effort and increasing likelihood of success.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/27.png" alt="brand standing Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Be mindful of not making it all about your personal-brand and placing that at the forefront of everything you do.
            </p><p>Personal-brand is a concept in business that seeks to give a ‘label’ to how you are perceived by others based on your actions, words and alignment.
            </p><p>"Personal-brand-standing" is a concept I just made up to label when focusing on personal-brand is taken too far.
            </p><p>This looks like leveraging attention, projects and successes to reflect well on yourself for career reasons.
            </p><p>Acknowledging the work of others and sharing success is a powerful motivator.

            </p><p>People will feel more comfortable if they can be honest, this grows trust, trust fosters openness and a sense of togetherness, which is a key part of teamwork.
            </p><p>This can be done by leading by example, choosing to be honest about emotions and vulnerabilities as well as taking the opportunity to check in with everyone regularly about how they are feeling.

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/30.png" alt="perspective Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>The skilled leader can see perspective, hear perspective and give perspective.
            </p><p>Being able to see and hear other people’s perspectives is important as it lets you understand where they are coming from and 'why'. It shows you care.
            </p><p>Being able to give perspective helps provide a better understanding of where everyone else is and 'why'. This in turn provides a unified direction with a clear ‘why’.
            </p><p>The skill of seeing and hearing perspective comes from asking and listening.
            </p><p>The skill of giving perspective comes from sharing, inviting and clarity.

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/31.png" alt="listening before reacting Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>A leader who can role model the skill of listening, considering then responding, promotes an environment of thoughtful action.
            </p><p>Thoughtful action benefits the way the team will interact with customers, each other and other teams by engaging reason to tailor outcomes based on consideration of circumstances.
            </p><p>Take the opportunity any time you are asked a question by the team to work through the thought process including, what is being taken into account and why. Likewise, when you pose a question in a meeting or coaching, don’t race to get the answer. Focus on the skill of walking through the considerations.

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/32.png" alt="leadership Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Management is primarily about getting a group from A to B. Successful Leadership is about instilling a sense of “all being in it together” getting from A to B.
            </p><p>Using the little boat example, a sense of “all being in it together” helps with the understanding that the actions of one impact the balance of the whole. Not everyone can steer the rudder all at once but we can all help guide by sharing what we see. Regardless of the seat we sit in we are all headed in the same direction. Working together increases the ability to control the controllables.
            </p><p>The ‘how’ is very easy, just keep reinforcing the message of being in it together, keep your eyes and ears open and consistently walk the talk.
            </p></figcaption></figure>

            <figure><img src="images/Penguins/33.png" alt="anger Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Anger alienates and closes down communication. Compassion and seeking to understand improves communication and therefore connection.
            </p><p>We all get frustrated, that’s natural. How you manage to transfer that frustration into something beneficial and constructive is an important leadership skill.
            </p><p>Why? It is very hard to undo something said in anger. When we are angry there is a higher chance we are in the fight or flight part of our brain which steals us away from the rational part of our brain, which understands consequences.
            </p><p>How? Practicing mindfulness techniques, Breathing techniques and appreciating that you can take some time before needing to respond can all help in having a healthier, more professional response to frustration.

           <figure> <img src="images/Penguins/37.png" alt="round table thinking Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Creating and leading a culture of equality strengthens a team dynamic and allows everyone equal opportunity to contribute and shape outcomes.
        </p><p>If people feel equal, they will feel their input is meaningful and are more likely to contribute.
        </p><p>This increase of 'input' grows the pool of ideas from different perspectives improving potential solutions.
        </p><p>Creating a culture of equality also increases feelings of fairness and therefore higher engagement taking you beyond getting just discretionary effort from a team.

           <figure> <img src="images/Penguins/41.png" alt="cracking the whip Penguin Illustration. Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Leaders that learn the difference between motivation and cracking the whip, unlock people's potential to grow.
        </p><p>Cracking the whip leads to fear based actions, where the sole motivation is to not get in trouble.
        </p><p>Motivating leads to wanting to take the journey to learn and the outcome becomes about the feel good factor of the work done that led to the win.
        </p><p>If you're not sure where you stand, asking the team is a good and brave place to start.

Original artwork by Lee Sampson"><figcaption> <p>Great leadership can take the same starting point, people and tools and through vision, people skills and creativity deliver special results.
            </p><p>Similar to the writing example, it's about understanding the bigger story and working back from that point.
            </p><p>From there, you can have a rough idea of what you need and start creating and building blocks to bring it to life.
            </p><p>It's also about being realistic, creating something new and special might take several drafts.

        </p><p>Unlike a superhero, it will often go unnoticed by all except family or a close friend.
        </p><p>These are the days you need to remember a superhero was needed and you selflessly obliged.
